      Horus was such a classic heroic tragedy it was overly cliche.<br> Ive been
      disappointed in horus as a charactor.<br> What a tool to have every reason to
      succeed yet stumble over the simplest blocks for such a mighty hero. You
      dont belive me? just check out this link

            <li><b>yet he still threw a fit like a child</b></li>
            <li><b>yet still lost faith in the emporor</b></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          He was the longest serving or <i>"eldests"</i>
          <ul>
            <li>spent the most time being tutored by the big man</li>
            <li>spent the most time watching his father work</li>
            <li>spent the most time watching his brothers be found</li>
            <li>spent the most time getting to know and trust the emperor</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          He was supposed to be the greatest statesman and general
          <ul>
            <li>
              He was known for talking his way out of as many wars as he fought
            </li>
            <li>
              He knew almost as many tactics for out thinking an enemy as he did
              for out fighting them
            </li>
            <li>He had fought and won countless battles at his fathers side</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          He was aware of his own greatest weaknesses from the start
          <ul>
            <li>It was no secret Horus was the most ambitious of his brothers</li>
            <li>
              Horus trained with his brothers on, was trained against and warned
              about his unchecked ambition
            </li>
            <li>
              He created the mornival to check his decisions against other
              opinions
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Even with all his wisdom and states craft he allowed himself to be
          manipulated
          <ul>
            <li>
              Horus was not manipulated by a fellow master statesman, but by
              erebus
            </li>
            <li>Horus knew Erebus was a snake as slimey as any other</li>
            <li>
              Even when the ruse was exposed by magnus, horus did not stop, he
              sided with a snake
            </li>
